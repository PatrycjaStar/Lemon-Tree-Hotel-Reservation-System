# Lemon-Tree-Hotel-Reservation-System
Design and implementation of a Hotel Reservation Application. The main purpose of the system is to aid employees in making and overseeing room bookings. The system offers only Single and Double rooms to book while the rest will be considered as future enhancements. Furthermore, the system accepts both standard and premium customers. The customer needs to reveal their loyalty status when booking the room.
